*TephraProb* is a toolbox of Matlab functions designed to produce scenario-based probabilistic hazard assessments for ground tephra accumulation using on the Tephra2 model. The toolbox includes series of GUIs that allow to:
- Retrieve and analyse wind conditions from the NOAA Reanalysis and the ECMWF ERA-Interim datasets; 
- Create calculation grids in UTM;
- Retrieve and analyse eruption datasets from the Global Volcanism Program database;
- Create distributions of eruption source parameters based on a wide range of probabilistic eruption scenarios;
- Run Tephra2 using the generated input scenarios;
- Compile exceedence probability maps, probabilistic isomass maps and hazard curves.

## Usage
In Matlab, navigate to the root of *TephraProb*, type
~~~
>> tephraProb
~~~
and press enter.
